Our application, **Infusic**, aligns with our studio brief because we are re-designing how music is presented to our users. We want our user base to be able to search for the right song in the most efficient way possible -- that is, through the integration of multiple streaming platforms into one space, as well as through user collaboration. By using Infusic, users will have an easier time choosing music and creating cohesive playlists with the features provided.
