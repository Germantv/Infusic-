# Infusic

Our application, **Infusic**, aligns with our studio brief because we are re-designing how music is presented to our users. We want our user base to be able to search for the right song in the most efficient way possible -- that is, through the integration of multiple streaming platforms into one space, as well as through user collaboration. By using Infusic, users will have an easier time choosing music and creating cohesive playlists with the features provided.

## Write a few detailed sentences identifying your point of view, user base, and core interaction 

**!!! NEED TO COME BACK AND MAKE THIS INTO A FEW SENTENCES !!!**

**POV**: Avoid wasting time looking for songs. Centralize your music today.
**User Base**: People who use multiple music streaming services, or people who are unsatisfied with current streaming services’ UI layout.
**Core Interaction**: Syncing and integration of assets of different music streaming services into one place (songs, playlists, albums).


## Write a few detailed sentences justifying whether or not you will change your point of view, user base, and/or core interaction, and if so what changes will you make?

Our point of view and user base will not be changed during the development of this application, as these are core concepts of our project. Our point of view encapsulates our studio brief as mentioned above, and is the main idea behind our project. Thus, it cannot be changed. Our user base would also still consist of the same users -- those who are looking to use multiple streaming services in one place, those who are unsatisfied with current UI designs, and/or those who want to build a cohesive set of music. These are the users that our point of view caters to, and thus will also not change.

Lastly, our core interaction, while also not changing, includes other interactions like Party Mode which allow users to interact with each other in the playlist-making process. This also aligns with our studio brief, because it presents other users’ tastes in music to the admin of the playlist in real-time, allowing for collaborative playlists that have a connected sound based on what everyone wants to listen to.
